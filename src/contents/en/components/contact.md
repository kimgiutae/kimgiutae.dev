I am currently working full-time in an international consultancy, but **I am always open to considering challenging proposals**, participating in open-source projects or start-ups ideas, or just chatting about related matters.

I am also passionate about education, which is why **I am working on content production for YouTube**, in order to share my experiences with other developers.

Below you have a form to facilitate communication by email, although it is probably faster through my social networks.
