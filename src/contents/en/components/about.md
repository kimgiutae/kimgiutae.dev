**I'am a web developer specialized in Front-end**, passionate about working on user interfaces that delight customers and drive the brand's image and objectives.

I believe that a good application is the one that delivers the information that the user is looking for, as quickly as possible and in a pleasant environment. In a nutshell, **the user experience must be, in order of importance: intuitive, fast and elegant**.

To develop this kind of applications, I found in the React ecosystem all the necessary tools to achieve it:

- **Next.js** for static and/or highly dynamic applications.
- **Expo** for native mobile applications.
- **Electron** for desktop applications.

Of course, throughout my career I have had to work with many other technologies for building UIs, such as: PHP/Twig, SAPUI, and more recently Angular. But I have learned that, **as long as the principles are clear, you can make a good application with any technology** (moderately established technology).

With more than a decade of professional experience in the IT area, **I worked on small and large projects, local companies and international consultancies**. This has not only shaped me as a professional, but also as a person and communicator.

Also, I am currently working full time as a senior consultant.

## My history with computers:

Since I was little, **I had only two favorite subjects in school: mathematics and art**. Looking back now, I think these were the first signs of my future vocation of combining programming logic with graphic design.

At home, my favorite toys were LEGO bricks. I spent hours assembling my own designs, and trying to achieve that professional and beautiful look like the originals. I always had that artistic interest in things.

**My first computer was a Hewellt-Packard Vectra 500**. On this hulk with Windows 95 and powerful 2Mb of RAM, I took my first steps in the world of programming. Thanks to MS-DOS, concepts like terminal, commands, folders and files began to take hold in my young mind.

Years passed, computers evolved, and like every good millennial, video games became a passion. Mainly simulation and strategy ones, such as Age of Empires, SimCity and the Tycoon saga (Oh! Great days!). But it was more than just entertainment. I was very interested in the intricate complexity of each unit, the relationship between them and their programmed intelligence. In fact, **I started developing my own games at home with some languages based on Basic** like Blitz3D.

Maintaining the artistic side, in my free time, I liked to draw, and **create animations with Adobe Flash and PowerPoint** with the use of slides as frames (Oh! Great days x2!).

In high school I had a unique opportunity, **investing the last 3 years of high school in a Intensive Professional Technical Course**. This was a decision that definitively marked my career choice in the IT area.

**In high school I learned programming logic with Turbo Pascal**, algorithms, a lot of office automation, networking concepts, and I got used to using Linux. Also, around that time **I got my first jobs with Joomla and developed solutions for this CMS using PHP and SQL**.

After finishing high school, when I officially entered the working world in a digital development agency, I had to work a lot with WordPress, PHP and MySQL.

So in summary, the technologies that I used in my long career were:

- MS-DOS, Windows and Office
- Turbo Pascal
- Basic and Blitz3D
- Linux and bash
- WordPress, Joomla, PHP and SQL
- JavaScript, jQuery, HTML and CSS
- Node.js, gulp, pug, sass, uglify, browsersync, etc.
- Git and Github
- React.js, Next.js, Remix, Angular, and other UI libraries.

Obviously this is not an exhaustive list, but they were impotent steps.

## A little about my past:

My father and his family emigrated from South Korea to seek new opportunities in the new continent. First they landed in Argentina, then they moved to Brazil and also to the United States.

**I was born in Argentina**, and since my mother is from there, **my native language is Spanish**. Then, as a teenager I moved to Brazil, a wonderful country where I currently live. That's why **Portuguese became my second language**.

English has also always been part of my life, whether through high school, television series, friends who live abroad, and in recent years, for work. That's why **English is my third language**, at an almost native level.

Speaking of languages, others that I have some fluency in are, from more to less: Korean, Italian and French. In fact, learning languages is one of my great interests.

The fact of having lived among so many cultures and languages has given me a very valuable opportunity: to better understand people and their behavior. A skill that has helped me a lot when managing work teams.

I would like to highlight the role that my parents played, instilling in me moral values that I will carry throughout my life, and that have served me even more than any technical knowledge I may have acquired.

## Passions and interests:

Like most programmers, **I love to program in my free time**. Currently, I am experimenting with new technologies related to animations, vectorization, and also artificial intelligence.

In the field of sports, **football is a great passion**. Some of my favorite teams are: Boca Juniors, Barcelona, Manchester United and, most recently, Inter Miami (for obvious reasons). Other physical activities that I like to practice are: gym, cycling, basketball and badmington.

Other interests and hobbies are:

- **Read**, especially science fiction and history.
- **Travel** to other countries whenever possible.
- Prepare good **coffee**.
- Learn and practice **languages** (as I mentioned before).

Lastly and most important for me. For a decade now, I have dedicated much of my life to doing educational and religious volunteer work. Something that has brought me a happiness that I wouldn't change for anything.

In short, I enjoy an uncomplicated and meaningful life, with good friends, an incredible family and a job that I find exciting. And **I think this is a privilege that few find, and for which I am enormously grateful**.
